# Changelog

All notable changes to the **Storyteller engine**. Newest version on top.

Each campaign carries a `VERSION` file naming the engine it last synced to. When you tell the GM *"update storyteller,"* it compares your `VERSION` to the latest, applies the changes below, and follows any **Campaign migration** note to reconcile files you've already filled in — without erasing your story. See `UPDATING.md` for how the sync works.

Version numbers are `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:
- **PATCH** — wording or fixes to engine files. Safe; no migration.
- **MINOR** — new features or new engine files. May add an *optional* **Campaign migration** step.
- **MAJOR** — changes that need attention to your existing save data. Always carries a migration note.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-06-02

First versioned release. This is the baseline the update system measures from; campaigns started before this carry no `VERSION` file and are treated as "pre-1.0, update available."

### Added
- **Engine-update mechanism** — `VERSION`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `UPDATING.md`. You can now pull newer engine files into an existing campaign with *"update storyteller,"* and the GM will leave your character, world, and history untouched.

### Changed
*(Recent engine work, folded into the baseline.)*
- **NPC isolation is now structural.** The `npc-actor` subagent runs with no file tools (`tools: []`), so a character's voice literally cannot reach `secrets.md` or `gm-secrets.md` — the guarantee no longer rests on instructions alone.
- **Recurring characters remember you.** The actor is now handed the character's `memory.md` alongside `profile.md`, fixing the "old ally greets you like a stranger" bug. `secrets.md` still never leaves the GM.
- **Deeper solo-play GMing** in `CLAUDE.md` — adversary honesty and "don't over-resolve" directives, three-tier outcomes, a d6 oracle for world-state questions, progress clocks, a condition track with teeth, fiction-driven advancement, a co-author input model, an in-media-res resume, and an end-of-session ritual.

### Campaign migration
- **`Game/boundaries.md` gained a `## Narrative voice` section** (Person / Tense / Density), set during Session Zero so the GM's prose style stays as consistent as the facts do. If your campaign began before this and your `boundaries.md` has no such section, ask the GM to add it — it will splice in the block below, just before `## Lines — never include`, and leave your Tone, Lines, and Veils exactly as you wrote them:

  ```markdown
  ## Narrative voice
  How the GM should *write*, so the feel stays consistent session to session.
  - **Person:** second ("you draw your blade") or third ("Kara draws her blade")?
  - **Tense:** present or past?
  - **Density:** spare and punchy, lush and descriptive, or somewhere between?
  ```
